# Studies
<p>
  I'ts all about my studies in here. I practice, try something little, start to
  understand somethings about what I'm currently learning and put it and practice.
</p>
<p>
  There's no order when I start do practice. Today in the morning,
  I could start to learn something about node, in the evening, something about html,
  at night, something about php.
</p>
<p>
  Besides it's note recommended (to learn a lot of things all the same time), for me
  is better 'cause I can learn from other language something I hadn't learned first time with other one.
</p>
<p>
  I can show the example of using terminal: I started using terminal with node, all of a mess! gotcha nothing 'bout it.
  Then I started to learn git in command line. Suddenly, all of that line codes started to make sense. When I started python, better than before.
  Now it's more suitable to me use command line in certain situations, like git.
</p>
<p>
    Other example is when I saw something 'bout require in node, the same as above: confusing. Then, started to see require modules in python, it all
    started to make sense to me! I was even able to create a basic server in the node, a complete victory to me haha. As soon as I can, I'll try
    some back end things in php again, now I understood a little bit more bout it in node.
</p>
<p>
  That's all folks! haha.
